# CS 120 Module 1 Open-Ended Project: James Bush

No needed installation.

## Summary
This program is a game I've titled "Gravium: Defense Agaisnt The Obsidian". The user will create a team of four heroes and battle the villain team. The villain team, called The Obsidian, is trying to gain control of a newly discovered source of Gravium, a precious metal that gives its holder the ability to manipulate gravity. The user must create a team of heroes to battle The Obsidian in a Pokemon style fight to keep the Gravium deposit out of the hands of The Obsidian.

## Bugs
Right now there are no bugs, but the game is not implemented at its full yet.

## Future Work
I also have some TODO comments to allow the user to select a hero from the output file, edit the villain team, and I also want to clean up the battle method to make it cleaner. I would also like to incorporate some visuals or sounds.

## Grading
For this project I believe I could earn 65 points or just under. The Character class serves as a parent for the Hero and Villain which are derived from the Character class. I also make use of file input/output. I have each new Hero created written to the output file and the user can  view the list of all created heroes by looking through the file. Lastly, I implemented the battle method in GameOperations which was a farily hefty method and covers all the functions that I want out of the battle method right now.
